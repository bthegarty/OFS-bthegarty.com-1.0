# bthegarty.com Version 1.2.0 OFS
This repository contains the original version of my website that was taken down to be replaced with more modern techniques that I learned in the past year


## About this version 

This version was made in an attempt to focus on basic css as well as angular JS to build a one page application. It was simple and helped me learn basic and best practices for building a personal website. As always I am constantly trying to become better as a developer.
